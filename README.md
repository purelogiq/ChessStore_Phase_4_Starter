67272 Chess Store Project: Phase 4 Starter
===

This is the starter code for Phase 4 of the [67-272 Chess Store Project](http://67272.cmuis.net/projects).  This starter code includes all models from previous phases and passing unit tests for those models.

You will need to run `bundle install` to get the needed testing gems. You can populate the development database with realistic data by running `rake dp:populate`.  However, this data will only be for the models in built in phase 2 and not for the new ones you are adding in this phase.
